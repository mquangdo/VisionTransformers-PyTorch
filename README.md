# VisionTransformers-PyTorch
The Vision Transformer (ViT) model challenges the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision by demonstrating that a Transformer architecture, applied directly to images as sequences of "patches," can achieve competitive or even superior performance. This implementation provides a foundation for understanding and experimenting with ViT.
